<h2>Tools ( a brief explanation )</h2>
To begin with, our initial step was to establish the design of our project. After that, we utilized Figma to create a prototype before proceeding with further development. Simultaneously, we made a decision regarding the web app architecture we would employ. Considering the small scale of our application, cost-effectiveness, and minimal resource requirements, we opted for a monolithic architecture.<br>

Once the prototype was completed and the architecture was determined, we proceeded to divide the tasks. For the frontend, we established a development environment using React JS. In terms of the API, we chose to build our own from scratch. Our custom API, known as the JAW API, is based on FastAPI.
As for the backend, we concluded that implementing Firebase would be the most suitable choice. Its simplicity aligns well with the NoSQL approach we aimed to incorporate.Lastly, we deploy our website using Vercel.<br>
